<h1 id = "91">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Celebrate 91<sup>th</sup> National Day</h1>
<p class = "sheet2">
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s leadership and people will celebrate tomorrow, thursday, <b><em>September 23, 2021 </em></b>, the 91th National Day of Saudi Arabia, after the historical <br>announcement of the late King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia’s unification under "There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is<br>the Messenger of Allah" banner.<br><br>
Saudi National Day is the day on which the late founder named the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia throughout the country, after 32 years of wars.
On that day, a young country was<br>established that prided itself by the application of the Islamic Sharia and its preservation of human values, promoting peace and goodness and in search of knowledge and<br>development towards a better future for its people, the Islamic nation and the whole world.<br><br>
King Abdulaziz ordered at the beginning of structuring Saudi Arabia to pay great attention to the Two Holy Mosques and their expansion and to serving pilgrims and Umrah<br>performers, as well as establishing schools and hospitals, building villages, rehabilitating the soil, and exploring irrigation water in order to support agriculture.<br><br>
Then, King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was the first to follow this approach and to work within its framework until the features of progress emerged and the structures of a<br>number of basic institutions and agencies in the country were completed.<br><br>
In the era of the pioneer of Islamic solidarity, who succeeded King Saud, King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, achieving accomplishments continued, and during his reign, the<br>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia began the implementation of the ambitious five-year plans for development.<br><br>
In the reign of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, building and growth continued to serve the country and citizens in particular and Islam and Muslims in general. The<br>development plans also connected with each other for the sake of achieving more prosperity and stability.<br><br>
The achievements during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud were characterized by comprehensiveness and integration to form a comprehensive development<br>process for building a nation and a wise and unique leadership that embodied many qualities that he had, the most prominent of which was his adherence to the holy Quran<br>and prophetic Sunnah, and his dedication to serving his homeland, citizens, the Islamic nation and the entire humankind.<br><br>
During the era of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia witnessed more giant developmental <br>achievements throughout the nation in various sectors, including education, health, transportation, industry, electricity, water, agriculture and the economy.<br><br>
Today, Saudi Arabia witnesses a distinguished present, looking forward to a more distinguished future full of confidence in the title of the stage, the Custodian of the Two <br>Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who has been making, since the beginning of his reign, an effort to advance Saudi Arabia. The activities varied in various <br>fields at regional and international levels, preceded by accomplishments at various stages during his reign in many positions.<br><br>
Today, Saudi Arabia’s National Day passes by while we live in a bright reality established by the late founder King Abdulaziz. <sub>source : SPA</sub>
